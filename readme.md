# Donation App designed for The Spark Foundation

This website, developed for the [Spark Foundation](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=sparks+foundation&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), integrates Razorpay for seamless payment processing. Users can easily select the amount they wish to donate and choose from various payment methods, including UPI (Google Pay, PayTM, PhonePe), cards, UPI/QR, net banking, and ICICI Pay Later.

Upon successful payment, an e-receipt is automatically generated and sent to the userâ€™s email, detailing the donated amount. Additionally, a daily summary of all payments received is sent to the foundation, ensuring smooth tracking and transparency of donations.
